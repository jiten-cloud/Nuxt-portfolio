content: |
  Hi, I'm **Jitender Kumar**, a Full Stack Developer with 2.8+ years of professional experience, currently working at Vanilla Networks. I specialize in building scalable, production-ready web applications using **Next.js, SvelteKit, Node.js, and NestJS**.

  My journey into software development started with a strong interest in how complex systems work behind the scenes and how clean, intuitive interfaces can simplify real-world problems. Over time, I’ve worked across the stack — from crafting responsive user interfaces to designing robust backend APIs and database schemas.

  ### My Development Philosophy

  My approach to development is rooted in **clarity, scalability, and reliability**. I believe good software is easy to use, easy to maintain, and built with long-term growth in mind. I focus on writing clean, modular code and following best practices that make systems easier to scale and evolve.

  Whether I’m building interactive frontends, designing REST APIs with **NestJS**, or working with relational databases like **MariaDB**, my goal is always to deliver solutions that are both technically sound and valuable to the business.

  ### What Drives Me

  I’m driven by the challenge of solving real-world problems through technology and continuously learning new tools and patterns. Working on features like media-heavy platforms, authentication systems, and interactive workflows keeps me motivated and helps me grow as an engineer.

  ### Beyond the Code

  Outside of work, I enjoy exploring new technologies, improving my system design knowledge, and contributing to personal or experimental projects. I’m always curious about how modern web stacks evolve and how they can be used to build better products.
